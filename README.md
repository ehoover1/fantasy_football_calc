# fantasy_football_calc

The first year that I played fantasy football in my work league, I was given the last overall draft spot. Fair enough. But, as it turns out, the league was not using a
snake draft (as is typical) to even out the league talent, but a straight draft in which I would pick last each round. In other words, I was destined to get the 
worst players, and by a wide margin.

I decided to use my statistics training to build my own method of ranking potential draft picks. The methodology is based around the idea that the most valuable 
players are not necessarily the ones that score the most absolute points but, rather, the ones that outscore the player they are matched up against by the widest margin.

More detail and justification can be found in the comments included in the .py file. 

And for all it's worth, I did end up winning first place in the league that year!
